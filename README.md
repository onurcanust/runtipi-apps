## ⚠️ Warning

This app store is a **personal hobby project**.

Please keep the following in mind:

- Applications are provided **as-is**
- I try to keep apps working and reasonably up to date, but **no guarantees are provided**
- I have **limited spare time** and cannot offer continuous user support
- Apps may be **updated, changed, or removed at any time**
- Use this app store **at your own discretion**
