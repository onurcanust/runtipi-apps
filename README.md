# RunTipi Apps (Experimental)

This repository contains an **experimental RunTipi app store**.

It is mainly used as a personal playground to explore RunTipi, Docker-based apps, and homelab tooling, while also making the setup reusable for others who might find it useful.

Apps included here are configured in a way that works for **my own setup and preferences**, and may evolve over time.

## 🧪 Project Status

This app store should be considered **experimental**.

- App definitions may change without notice
- Configuration defaults are opinionated
- Breaking changes are possible
- Long-term stability is **not guaranteed**

If you are looking for a strictly stable or production-grade app store, this repository is probably **not the right fit**.

> [!WARNING]
> This app store is **experimental** and maintained in my spare time.
>
> It exists primarily for learning, experimentation, and personal use — **not** as a production-ready service.
>
> I try to keep applications functional and reasonably up to date, but there are **no guarantees** regarding stability, availability, or support.
>
> I may not be able to respond to support requests, and applications can be modified or removed at any time as my setup, interests, or available time change.
>
> Please use this app store with that in mind.
